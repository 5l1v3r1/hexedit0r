this is hexedit0r, rofl0r's fork of hexedit 1.2.12
==================================================

differences from upstream hexedit:
  - colors are enabled by default
  - no autconf

requirements:
  - a C compiler, preferably GCC
  - ncurses headers and libraries
  - gnu make

installation:
  make CC=gcc [CFLAGS="-Wall"] [LDFLAGS="-static"] [-j16]
  make [prefix=/usr] [DESTDIR=$HOME] install
