this is hexedit0r, rofl0r's fork of hexedit 1.2.12
==================================================

differences from upstream hexedit:
  - colors are enabled by default
  - no autconf
  - less type bugs (like using int for sizes)

requirements:
  - a C compiler, preferably GCC
  - ncurses headers and libraries
  - gnu make

installation:
  make CC=gcc [CFLAGS="-Wall"] [LDFLAGS="-static"] [-j16]
  make [prefix=/usr] [DESTDIR=$HOME] install

in case your libc has memmem and/or memrmem, you can
add -DHAVE_MEMMEM / -DHAVE_MEMRMEM to your CFLAGS to use
the version provided by the libc.
likewise, if you have sys/mount.h, add -DHAVE_SYS_MOUNT_H.
